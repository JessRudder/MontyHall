MontyHall
=========

The readme file for the monty hall problem.  This program runs 100k+ tests of the monty hall game.  Each round has a player that randomly chooses an initial door.  We then track his outcome if he keeps his original door or changes to the door left by the host.  Both winning percentages are reported.
